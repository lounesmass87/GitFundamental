# git clone 

Cloninig a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be a clone, meaning it has all tracked commits and commit history.

It will also be associated with the remote, meaning tha you can use the `git pull` command to pull updates from the original repository.

It can be done with th `git clone` command as seen here:
```

git clone https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/TerminalDungeon.git
```
